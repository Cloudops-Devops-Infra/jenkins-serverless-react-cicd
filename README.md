# 🚀 Enterprise-Grade GitOps Pipeline: Automated IaC Provisioning, React Deployment & Full-Stack Observability

An advanced, self-contained DevOps pipeline that emulates an enterprise cloud deployment workflow and full-stack observability matrix completely on a local workstation. This project transitions traditional manual infrastructure deployment into a true GitOps lifecycle, utilizing Jenkins for orchestration, HashiCorp Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Docker Compose to encapsulate continuous integration runners, target cloud environments, and time-series telemetry databases.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The pipeline automates the journey from an infrastructure/code change in the repository to a live application hosted on an emulated cloud platform, while continuously streaming server health telemetry to a centralized visualization deck.

⚙️ Automated Pipeline Stages
1. Checkout Code
Dynamically pulls the infrastructure declarative configurations and deployment configurations from GitHub, establishing a clean execution tracking base inside the workspace.

2. Infrastructure Provisioning (IaC)
Bootstraps a self-contained, user-space Terraform binary within the workspace environment. Initializes provider subsystems, evaluates real-time configuration state against the environment, and executes an automated, hands-free provisioning run (terraform apply -auto-approve) to guarantee that the required target cloud architecture exists before application transport begins.

3. Build Website
Deploys a portable Node.js 18 execution runtime directly inside the pipeline track. Restricts directory focus to the application layer, installs project node dependencies, and compiles a production-optimized compilation artifact ready for edge-network delivery.

4. Deploy to Floci S3
Instantiates the automated AWS CLI delivery layer within the container home volume. Overrides global cloud routing variables to map directly onto the internal Docker container proxy matrix (host.docker.internal:4566), injects mock authorization signers, and handles cross-directory synchronization, moving the compiled frontend static layers directly into the designated S3 bucket.

📊 Live System Observability Matrix
To ensure the automation engine is monitored like a high-availability production asset, the pipeline integrates real-time systems telemetry scraping.

Metric Extraction: The Jenkins engine hooks directly into a Prometheus metrics extension endpoint at /prometheus/, broadcasting raw JVM application metrics and executor runtime data.

Scrape Interval: Prometheus sweeps the endpoint every 5 seconds, compiling system trends into a local database volume.

Visual Control Deck: Grafana consumes the time-series data and populates a custom Jenkins Performance and Health Overview Dashboard, exposing real-time dials for JVM memory usage, executor queue allocations, container CPU load, and stage build durations.

🖼️ Pipeline Visual Verification
1. Jenkins Automation Stage View
Validated proof execution showing the entire declarative orchestration pipeline passing flawlessly with a clean, consecutive green metrics state (Build #15 Success):

2. Centralized Grafana Telemetry Dashboard
The real-time time-series logging output showing active telemetry aggregation, container load indexes, JVM allocations, and live background scraping:

3. AIOps Self-Healing & Fault Tolerance
To ensure high availability, the infrastructure engine utilizes containerized restart policies coupled with live health telemetry. When core system services undergo disruptive updates (such as warm plugin JVM reloads), the orchestration layer automatically handles service restoration without human intervention.

💡 Real-World Engineering Roadblocks Overcome
🛡️ Challenge 1: Docker Container Loopback Networking Breakdown
The Symptom: Jenkins executing commands inside a container interpreted localhost as its own internal filesystem, rendering it blind to the cloud emulator running on the host machine.

The Resolution: Abstracted network paths by implementing a custom variable layer in the Terraform configuration, routing Jenkins traffic out of the container boundary using the host bridge endpoint (http://host.docker.internal:4566).

🌐 Challenge 2: S3 DNS Hosted-Style Address Routing Failure
The Symptom: By default, the AWS Terraform provider uses Virtual Hosted-Style bucket structures (e.g., http://bucket-name.localhost:4566). The internal container proxy DNS could not resolve these custom ad-hoc subdomains, leading to immediate no such host crashes.

The Resolution: Enforced Path-Style Addressing inside the AWS provider configuration block by setting s3_use_path_style = true. This forced Terraform to communicate over structural URL paths (http://host.docker.internal:4566/bucket-name), bypassing container DNS layout limitations.

🔑 Challenge 3: AWS CLI Credential Tracking Trap
The Symptom: The automated deployment agent threw a terminating error Unable to locate credentials, blocking asset transport despite communicating with a local mock emulator that required no authentication.

The Resolution: Configured a global environment block directly within the declarative Jenkinsfile, injecting persistent dummy cryptographic credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'mock-ops-key-id'). This satisfied the security validator check inside the AWS CLI utility wrapper without exposing sensitive production keys.

📦 Challenge 4: OCI Runtime File-vs-Directory Bind-Mount Conflict
The Symptom: When deploying the telemetry database, the container threw an OCI runtime exception (runc create failed: not a directory), immediately crashing Prometheus at startup.

The Resolution: Diagnosed that executing Docker commands from incorrect directories caused Windows to auto-generate an empty placeholder folder named prometheus.yml instead of pointing to the flat configuration text file. Resolved by purging container states, removing the corrupted folder path, and using proper terminal positioning to mount the clean configuration file.

🔄 Challenge 5: Internal Web UI Container Termination Crash
The Symptom: Forcing a Jenkins plug-in restart from inside the web control panel to activate the Prometheus exporter successfully stopped core automation tasks but killed the underlying Docker container process daemon entirely, dropping port 8080 offline.

The Resolution: Intercepted the crash lifecycle via terminal stream tracing (docker logs -f jenkins), bypassed the broken browser UI state, and executed low-level CLI container restoration steps (docker compose up -d) to safely load the new plugin extensions back into active memory, restoring the environment automatically.
